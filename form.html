				<p>I helped build and program a robot to compete in VEX Robotics competitions.</p>
				<p>As a proud member of 750S, I was the main programmer for our team during the 2018-2019 season. I did the majority of the coding for our autonomous period, programming skills, and I helped create our team website. We won the build award this season and qualified for the New Jersey State Championship.</p>

				<p>The following year, as an 11th grader, I was the vice captain of the team. I was also the driver of the robot and coordinated the team meetings. This year, we won Tournament Champions at the South Brunswick competition, qualifying for the state championship. Then, at states, we won the Design Award, qualifying for the VEX 2019-2020 Worlds Championship. Unfortunately, this was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

				<p>This year, I am the captain of our team. We have not yet gone to any competitions, but we have had online Zoom meetings and planned and cadded a potential design.</p>
